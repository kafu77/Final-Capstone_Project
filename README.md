# **Capstone Project**:
The capstone project was conducted to showcase the skills developed through a professional Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence program. The project utilized the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, which involves six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. The project aimed to answer a question of interest using various tools and techniques encountered during the program.

**Business Understanding**: 
The challenge for home buyers is the exorbitant house prices which prevent many people from buying their dream home. Instead of describing the physical features of their ideal home, people often begin with concerns about price negotiations. Many people are unable to afford their dream home due to the increasing cost of houses, leading them to live in rental properties. This situation is often exploited by real estate agents who charge high rent prices.

Goal: The project aims to compare regression models and select the best one that can predict an affordable sale price for residential home buyers in Ames, Iowa. The models will be trained on original feature data and log-transformed target, and the results will be compared to recommend the best model.
